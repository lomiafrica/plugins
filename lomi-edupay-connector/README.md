# EduPay × lomi. Connector

Partner integration for [Yele Group](https://www.yelegroup.africa/) **EduPay** — school fee collection via lomi. **direct charges** on a single merchant account.

Built on the same patterns as [`direct-charge-integration-reference`](../direct-charge-integration-reference).

## Architecture

```
EduPay backend  →  connector-api  →  @edupay/lomi-client  →  lomi. API
                         ↑
                   webhooks (PAYMENT_SUCCEEDED)
```

EduPay uses **one lomi merchant organization**. Schools are logical records in EduPay (`school_id` in charge metadata); settlement and reconciliation stay on that merchant account.

## Quick start

```bash
cd apps/plugins/lomi-edupay-connector
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — sandbox keys from dashboard.lomi.africa
pnpm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:3010** for the sandbox UI.

```bash
chmod +x curl/*.sh
./curl/charge-fee.sh
```
